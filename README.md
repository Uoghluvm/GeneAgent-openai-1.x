## Title

GeneAgent: Self-verification Language Agent for Gene Set Analysis using Domain Databases

## Abstract

GeneAgent is a first-of-kinds language agent built upon GPT-4 to automatically interact with domain-specific databases to annotate functions for gene sets. GeneAgent generates interpretable and contextually accurate biological process names for user-provided gene sets, either aligning with significant enrichment analyses or introducing novel terms. At the core of GeneAgentâ€™s functionality is a self-verification setting. This mechanism autonomously interacts with various expert-curated biological databases through Web APIs. By utilizing relevant domain-specific information, GeneAgent performs fact verification and provides objective evidence to support or refute the raw LLM output, reducing hallucination and enabling reliable, evidence-based insights into gene function.

# Configuration:

## Installation

1. Apply an OpenAI Key from the Azure OpenAI service to activate the access of LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.

   OpenAI Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/
2. Create a virtual environment on your GPU terminate by using the anaconda command:

   ```
   conda create -n {envname} python=3.11
   ```
3. Activate the environment by using the command:

   ```
   conda activate {envname}
   ```
4. Install the required packages one by one with the command:

   ```
   python install {package} == {version}
   ```

## Download

1. Create a directory for GeneAgent in your own workplace
2. Download this respoisit directly to your directory or git the respoisit by:
   ```
   git@github.com:ncbi-nlp/GeneAgent.git
   ```

## Replace the openai key

1. Go to the created directory of GeneAgent
   ```
   cd {directory}
   ```
2. Open the **.env copy** file and replace the API configuration with your own settings:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OWN_OPENAI_KEY
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=YOUR_OWN_OPENAI_BASE_SETTING
   ```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to rename the file from **.env copy** to **.env** after updating the configuration. This centralized configuration will be used by all GeneAgent variants including **main_cascade.py**, **main_CoT.py**, **main_summary.py**, and **worker.py**.

# Execute

## Running

Type following command in your virtual environment.

```
python main_cascade.py
```

The results will be stored accordingly.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to evaluate your own gene sets, save them to **Dataset** directory and change the directory path in the **main_cascade.py**
> Also, the output path can be changed according to your preference.

## Example outputs

Process: MAPK Signaling Pathway
The proteins encoded by the genes ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, FGFR4, HRAS, and KRAS are all integral components of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth, differentiation, and survival.
ERBB2 and ERBB4 are members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). ERBB2 is unique in that it has no known ligands, and it prefers to form heterodimers with other EGFR family members, enhancing their kinase activity. ERBB4 is activated by neuregulins and other factors and induces a variety of cellular responses including mitogenesis and differentiation.
FGFR2 and FGFR4 are part of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family of RTKs. They are activated by fibroblast growth factors, leading to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. This triggers downstream signaling pathways that regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration.
HRAS and KRAS are GTPases that act as molecular switches in RTK signaling. They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP. Once activated, RAS proteins can interact with a variety of effector proteins to propagate the signal downstream.
The interaction between these proteins forms a complex network of signaling events that regulate key cellular processes. Dysregulation of this system, such as mutations that lead to constitutive activation of RTKs or RAS proteins, can result in uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. Therefore, understanding the precise mechanisms of MAPK signaling and its regulation is crucial for the development of targeted cancer therapies.
