I will give you a list of human genes together with functional descriptions of some genes or gene set in all human genes.
Perform a term enrichment test on the human genes, i.e., tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
Only report gene functions in common, not diseases. 
e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis", then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
Here is the human gene set: {genes}
